Notes:
**Development**
- Follow the mockup as a general rule, not a hard rule
- We'll base the website on 1920px width | No responsiveness as of the moment
- All resources should be offline or loaded locally
- All resources are already uploaded. Add the additional resources on the proper directories
- The sections of the site is already divided in the index.html
- For the header and footer, a separate css file for each of them is provided
- For the other sections, use the index.css


**Git / Github**
- We'll use the Shared Repository Model
- Make a new branch and DON'T commit directly on the MASTER branch
- Submit a Pull Request after making your own commits with a short description of what you did
- A good practice is making miniscule commits rather than making a one big commit
- For technical problems, it is advisable to use the internet first before asking help from others
- Feel free to contact me, Ralp Kendall Abad, or the other members for any concerns

Thank you :>

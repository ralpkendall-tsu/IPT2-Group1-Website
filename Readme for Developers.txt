Notes:
- Follow the mockup as a general rule, not a hard rule
- We'll base the website on 1920px width | No responsiveness as of the moment
- All resources should be offline or loaded locally
- All resources are already uploaded. Add the additional resources on the proper directories

- Make a new branch and DON'T commit directly on the MASTER branch
- Submit a Pull Request after making your own commits with a short description of what you did
- A good practice is making miniscule commits rather than making a one big commit
- For technical problems, it is advisable to use the internet first before asking help from others
- Feel free to contact me for any concerns
